    <p>Hello, my name is Darnell I am a mature student currently studying at the university of northampton. I am currently taking the course of computer systems engineering for 3 years. I am a computer fanatic which loves play around on computers in my spare time; when not doing anything else. </p>

<p>When i'm not playing around with computers, I am being active either at the gym, riding my bike or playing football with friends. Football is something which i really enjoy both playing and watching, being interested in the sports since i was knee height, first joining team at the age of 11. I played for a team which goes by the name of Genesis for 5 years leaving when i was 16 finding a new interest being videography; creating a youtube channel showcasing young talent such as dance, poetry, singing etc.</p>

<p>I am quite interested in a variety of music styles, having my headphones in the majority of the time getting my groove on. I enjoy listening to rap, afrobeats and house, attending student union every tuesday partying with my friends, as they have similar interest as i do. </p>

<p>I spend a lot of time with my friends, keeping them company with my humour always keeping a smile on my friends faces. </p>
